# Personal Portfolio Site

This is my personal portfolio site, built using [React](https://react.dev) and [Next.js](https://nextjs.org). I designed and developed this site to showcase my professional experience, skills, and projects. The codebase is managed with [GitHub](https://github.com), and the site is deployed on [Vercel](https://vercel.com).
